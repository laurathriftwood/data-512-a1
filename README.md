# A1: Data Curation
## Autumn 2021

The goal of this assignment is to construct, analyze, and publish a dataset of monthly traffic
on English Wikipedia from January 1 2008 through August 30 2021.

The purpose of the assignment is to demonstrate that you can follow best practices for
open scientific research in designing and implementing your project, and make your
project fully reproducible by others: from data collection to data analysis.
For this assignment, you combine data about Wikipedia page traffic from two different
Wikimedia REST API endpoints into a single dataset, perform some simple data processing
steps on the data, and then analyze that data.

Relevant API documentation


Describe the values of all fields in your final data file.


List any known issues or special considerations with the data that would be useful
for another researcher to know. For example, you should describe that data from
the Pageview API excludes spiders/crawlers, while data from the Pagecounts API
does not.
